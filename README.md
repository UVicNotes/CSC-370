## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute your notes please start by forking the repository. Notes should be taken in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and we support MathJax (basically LaTeX) for math. Notes should be clear and concise and should have build off of the master notes for that day.

If you have any questions you please feel free to [contact](mailto:brynn@hawker.me) the repository maintainer.
